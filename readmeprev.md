## Introduction

The **8 Week SQL Challenge** is a collection of hands-on case studies designed to sharpen your SQL proficiency. Each case mirrors a realistic business scenario, and you'll be challenged to extract insights using structured queries.
Danny is a die-hard fan of Japanese cuisine and in early 2021 decided to launch a cozy restaurant offering his three favorite dishes: **sushi**, **curry**, and **ramen**.

This repo contains my answers, explanations, and any helpful resources I used throughout the challenge.
Although the food has heart, the business needs help, Danny has gathered some basic transactional data but lacks the skills to extract meaningful insights. That‚Äôs where this case study begins.

As part of my data analyst portfolio, this project demonstrates how SQL can be used to support business decisions in the restaurant industry.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Danny is interested in understanding customer behavior to improve operations and customer retention. Specifically, he wants to uncover:

- How often customers visit
- What they order most frequently
- How much they‚Äôve spent
- How effective the current loyalty program has been

With these insights, he hopes to enhance the dining experience and decide whether to expand his loyalty rewards system.

## Case Study Solutions
## üßæ Datasets Used

Each case study has its own folder containing the solution:
Three key tables form the foundation of this case study:

- **#1 ‚Äì Danny's Diner**
- **#2 ‚Äì Pizza Runner**
- **#3 ‚Äì Foodie-Fi**
- **#4 ‚Äì Data Bank**
- **#5 ‚Äì Data Mart**
- **#6 ‚Äì Clique Bait**
- **#7 ‚Äì Balanced Tree Clothing Co**
- **#8 ‚Äì Fresh Segments**
- `sales`: Records each customer's order history including `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `product_id`
- `menu`: Maps each `product_id` to its `product_name` and `price`
- `members`: Tracks when each customer joined the loyalty program via `join_date`

## How to Use
## Case Study Questions + Bonus

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?  
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?  
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?  
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?  
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?  
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?  
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?  
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?  
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?  
10. In the first week after a customer joins (including join date), they earn 2x points on all items, how many points do customers A and B have at the end of January?

1. Clone this repository to your local environment
2. Ensure PostgreSQL or your preferred SQL tool is installed
3. Navigate into any case study folder you're interested in
4. Read the Markdown files for explanations and query links (e.g. DB Fiddle)
5. (Optional) Execute the queries in your own SQL client or DB browser
### Bonus Questions

Each `.md` file includes a direct DB Fiddle link so you can run queries instantly without setting up anything locally.
